# 📘 Day 1: Introduction to Python

**Welcome to Day 1** of your _30 Days of Python journey!_ Today, we are laying the foundation for your programming career. Python is one of the most popular, versatile, and beginner-friendly languages in the world. Its syntax is designed to be readable, almost like English, making it the perfect starting point for any aspiring developer.

To get regular **AI & Tech** updates — stay ahead with the **latest tools, trends, and insights!** 🚀, you may join the [AI For Techies Channel](https://whatsapp.com/channel/0029VbBfR3TCRs1wxJSjOE2z)

## Key Concepts

In today's lesson, we will cover the absolute essentials to get your first script running:

* **Python Syntax:** Understanding the basic structure of a Python file.

* **The `print()` Function:** How to output text and data to the console.

* **Comments:** Writing notes for yourself and others that the computer ignores.

* **Basic Arithmetic:** Using Python as a calculator.

* **String Basics:** How Python handles text (characters inside quotes).

## Code Examples

Copy the following code into your editor. Pay close attention to the comments (lines starting with #), as they explain what each line does.

```shell
# ---------------------------------------------------------
# DAY 1: INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON
# ---------------------------------------------------------

# The print() function displays whatever is inside the parentheses
print("Hello, Python World!")

# You can use single quotes or double quotes for text (strings)
print('Welcome to Day 1 of the 30-Day Challenge.')

# Python can perform mathematical calculations directly
print(10 + 5)   # Addition
print(20 - 7)   # Subtraction
print(4 * 3)    # Multiplication
print(10 / 2)   # Division

# We can combine text and numbers using a comma in the print function
print("The result of 5 + 5 is:", 10)

# Comments (like this line) are ignored by Python. 
# They are used to document your logic.
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
It can span several lines.
Useful for longer explanations!
"""
```

## Execution Steps

To run this code on your computer, follow these simple steps:

1. **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python installed from [python.org](https://python.org).

2. **Open an Editor:** Open a simple text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) or a code editor like VS Code or PyCharm.

3. **Save the File:** Copy the code above and save it as a file named day1.py. *Note: The .py extension is crucial.*

4. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:**

* On Windows: Type cmd in the search bar.

* On Mac/Linux: Open the Terminal app.

5. **Navigate and Run:** Use the cd command to go to the folder where you saved the file, then type:

```shell
    python day1.py
```
(On some systems, you may need to type python3 day1.py).

## Mini Challenge

Now it's your turn! Create a new file named challenge1.py and write a script that does the following:

1. Print your name to the console.

2. Print a second line that says "I am learning Python for [Reason]", replacing [Reason] with your actual goal.

3. Use the print() function to calculate your age in 10 years (e.g., if you are 25, print 25 + 10).

4. Add a comment at the top of your file with your name and today's date.

**Keep going! You've just written your first Python script. See you on Day 2!**
